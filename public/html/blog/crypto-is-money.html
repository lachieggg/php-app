			<b>Cryptocurrency is money</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			The original reason we decided to give the responsibility of minting and regulation of fiat currency to the government is to prevent fraudulent notes. The original reason we gave money to banks was to safekeep the currency. Later on, we began to expect interest from banks safeguarding our funds.
			<br>
			<br>
			With cryptocurrencies, the fraudulent notes problem is solved through software. The safekeeping problem is solved using cryptography. Finally, instead of lending to centralized institutions, who in turn lend it out back to consumers, you can lend your coins directly to another person by pooling funds and lending on DeFi platforms. Therefore, all three current uses of fiat currency are superseded by software in blockchains and associated decentralized services.
			<br>
			<br>
			When people say that cryptocurrencies are not "backed by anything", what they mean is that they are not "backed by an institution", like a government or central bank. What these people fail to realize is that cryptocurrencies are instead backed by clever software and cryptography. Blockchains have automated validation (preventing fraudulent currency), and safekeeping (preventing theft of currency), which were traditionally performed by the central bank and private banks respectively. 
			<br>
			<br>
			These people have a rigid and immature concept of what money really is. Money is anything that is sufficiently scarce and securable. Anything that is sufficiently scarce has inherent value as a currency. Governments and central banks artificially create value of their own fiat currencies by introducing scarcity and preventing people from creating more through law enforcement. Cryptocurrencies do not have this problem, because the networks prevent fraudulent creation of new coins by design.
			<br>
			<br>
			The idea that in order for something to have value it has to be approved by the central bank is the kind of controlling attitude you would an authoritarian government.  Let private markets decide if something has value. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In summary, Bitcoin is backed by something, it's just that "thing" is not an institution. Instead it is backed by cryptography (and miners), which makes it securable, and software, which makes it sufficiently scarce.
