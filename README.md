lachiegrant.io
=
This is the web app source code for [my personal site](http://www.lachiegrant.io).

This repository is a full stack application, a combination of PHP and JavaScript.

[Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) is used as a PHP micro framework.

[Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent) is used as an ORM.

[Respect Validation](https://respect-validation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used as a validation engine.

[Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) is used as a template engine.

[Phinx](https://book.cakephp.org/phinx/0/en/index.html) is used for migrations.

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is the database driver.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is the simplest way to run this application.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is used as a front end package manager.

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used for bundling the JavaScript. 

Security
=
Currently there is CSRF and XSS protection implemented.

MySQL injection protection is also built in.

All passwords are stored as a hash in the database with a salt.

HTTPS redirection is enforced.

Base
=
To get started you will need both `composer` and `docker`

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [Docker](http://www.docker.com/).

Installation
=
Run:

`composer update`

`composer install`

`cp .env.sample .env`

`composer start`

`composer migrate`

`npm install`

`npm run build`

Docker
=
To run with Docker, all you need to do is run `composer start` while the Docker daemon is running.

Configuration
=
You will need to edit `.env` to have your own settings for database connections.

For SSL/TLS, the keys and certs go in `docker/nginx/tls/private` and `docker/nginx/tls/certs` respectively.

You can utilize the `scripts/` directory for installing necessary dependencies for [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).

You may also want to edit the `docker/nginx/config/nginx.website.conf` file to set the IP address to be your server IP.

Doing so will prevent direct IP access to your server which is recommended to prevent issues with SSL/TLS. 

You should also edit the `nginx` config discussed above to enter your server domain name.

The custom JavaScript files are stored in `js`. Some output source files will be generated by `npm`. Those are stored in `public/js/autogenerated`.

The server will not respond to HTTP requests using curl or wget unless the HTTPS protocol is used.

This is because HTTP requests are redirected to their HTTPS equivalent by default.
